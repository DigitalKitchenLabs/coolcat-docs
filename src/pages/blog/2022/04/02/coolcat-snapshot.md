WELCOME, COOLCATS❕
It’s time for another long awaited update from the tips of my paws! We’re bringing the answers to some of your most burning questions, updates on our progress and we’re also revealing the winners of our latest contest. Keep your pointy ears peeled! 😺

So, as you all know, our development team has been working 🕜 round the clock 🕚 to get CoolCat into shape, so we are delighted to announce that CosmWasm, the framework for our smart contracts, has been successfully integrated in the $CCAT blockchain❗🎊 Additionally, an in-house testnet has been deployed and is now being battle-tested with further development of our webapp, meaning we are progressing ahead of schedule! ↗️ Isn’t that amazing? 🙀

Furthermore, CoolCat has been updated to version 0.45.1 of the Cosmos SDK, ensuring that we can integrate Interchain Account functionality in the future. In other words, it’s all going very well.

Let’s talk snapshots next. We know a lot of our community members are unsure exactly when the snapshots for our first CatDrop were taken, so here are the official numbers. 📊

In terms of block chain / height / date, the first $CCAT snapshots were taken at:

1️⃣ Juno – 2433572 (25th March 2022, 20:36:17 UTC)

2️⃣ Juno Proposal 16 Participation Bonus – 2293382 (15th March 2022 15:21:09 UTC)

3️⃣ Cosmos $ATOM & Outside Top 20 Bonus – 9862150 (24th March 2022, 07:55:55 UTC)

4️⃣ Chihuahua $HUAHUA – 1294333 (14th March 2022 03:12:10 UTC)

These Juno dates mean that if you participated in the vote for proposal 16 but undelegated afterwards, you will unfortunately not have qualified for the maximum amount of $CCAT available in the CatDrop.

If you still aren’t sure whether or not you qualified for any part of the airdrop, we will have an allocation tracker built into our webapp ahead of launch, so you will be able to see ahead of time if you are eligible. Best of luck❕

Now, the giveaway.


Last week, we announced a meme contest within our community, giving away a total 2,000,000 $CCAT and a spot in our exclusive #hall-of-fame channel. After careful consideration, the winners are….
